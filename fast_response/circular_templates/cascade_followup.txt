Subject:  IceCube-Cascade-<alert_name>: Upper limits from a search for additional neutrino events in IceCube

The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

IceCube has performed a search for additional track-like muon neutrino events arriving from the direction 
of IceCube-<alert_name> (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/<gcn_number>.gcn3) in a time range of 1000 seconds centered on the alert 
event time (<start_utc> UTC to <stop_utc> UTC) during which IceCube was collecting good quality data. Excluding 
the event that prompted the alert, <n_events> additional track-like events <is_are> found in spatial coincidence with the 
We find that these <##> additional events are well described by atmospheric 
background expectations, with a p-value of <short_p>. We accordingly derive a time-integrated
muon-neutrino flux upper limit at the alert position of E^2 dN/dE = <upper_limit> TeV cm^-2 at 90% CL,
under the assumption of an E^-2.5 power law. 90% of events IceCube would detect from a source at this declination 
with an E^-2.5 spectrum are approximately between <low_en> and <high_en>.

A subsequent search was performed in a time range of 2 days centered on the alert event time
(<month_start_utc> UTC to <stop_utc> UTC). In this case, we report a p-value of <long_p>, 
consistent with no significant excess of track events, and a corresponding
time-integrated muon-neutrino flux upper limit assuming an E^-2.5 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE) of 
<long_upper_limit> TeV cm^-2 at the 90% CL.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica.
