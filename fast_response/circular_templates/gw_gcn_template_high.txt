SUBJECT: LIGO/Virgo <name>: <N> counterpart neutrino candidate from IceCube neutrino searches

IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

Searches for track-like muon neutrino events detected by IceCube consistent with the sky 
localization of gravitational-wave candidate <name> in a time range of 1000 seconds [1] 
centered on the alert event time (<tstart> UTC to <tstop> UTC) have been performed. 
During this time period IceCube was collecting good quality data. Two hypothesis tests 
were conducted. The first search is a maximum likelihood analysis which searches for a 
generic point-like neutrino source coincident with the given GW skymap [2]. The
second uses a Bayesian approach to quantify the joint GW + neutrino event significance, which
assumes a binary merger scenario and accounts for known astrophysical priors in the 
significance estimate, such as GW source distance [3].

<N> track-like event(s) are found in spatial and temporal coincidence with the gravitational-wave 
candidate <name> calculated from the map circulated in the <noticeID> notice. This
represents an overall p-value of <p_gwava> (<sig_gwava>sigma) from the generic transient search 
and an overall p-value of <p_llama> (<sig_llama>sigma) for the Bayesian search. These p-values 
measure the consistency of the observed track-like events with the known atmospheric backgrounds.

The reported p-values can differ due to the estimated distance of the GW 
candidate. The distance is used as a prior in Bayesian binary merger search, while it is not 
taken into account in the generic transient point-like source search.

Properties of the coincident events are shown below.

  dt        ra         dec    Angular Uncertainty(deg)  p-value(generic transient) p-value(binary merger)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <dt>   <ra>       <dec>          <angErr>                    <p_gwava>                 <p_llama>


where:
dt = Time offset (sec) of track event with respect to GW trigger.
Angular uncertainty = Angular uncertainty of track event: the radius of a circle 
     representing 90% CL containment by area.
Pvalue = the pvalue for this specific track event from each search.


The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the 
geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime alert point of contact can be 
reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
